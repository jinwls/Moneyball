Moneyball is base off the book _Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game_ by Michael Lewis. From the time, the owner of the team were not interested in spending money on the team's payroll. The A's, with $41 million payroll, had to face with teams like Yankees with $125 million payroll. 

The A's also had the misfortune of the need to replace their key players while having a low payroll.

On this condition, "moneyball" was invented as a necessity for the A's to compete in modern baseball.
